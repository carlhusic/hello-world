# hello-world
getting my feet wet ...

So even though I've been writing code for 40 years -
starting out with PDP-11 assembly code in 1978, and
continuing on writing about a million lines in at least
4 different machines languages, C, Pascal, TCL, VB, Java,
Python and Javascript -
I never got much into github (suffered through ClearCase
on one project).

Time to change that.
